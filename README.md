# AI Articles

A collection of AI Articles from across the web.

## Why?

This is an experiment. Over the years I have been collecting articles, but the format has been inconsistent. I decided to see if I could create a useful way to capture articles I have read using a Claude AI project. 

*Could I have done this in a simpler way?* Yes; and perhaps I will revisit this some day and improve it. 

*Could the article format been in a more "research" friendly format (e.g. Bibtex etc.)?* Yes; I decided to in this incarnation that I would go for more of a "1 pager" feel.

*Hey! This prompt looks like it was AI generated?* "Actshually" it was mostly me... But I got some help with the Role block fleshing this into something more detailed. The rest I have to take blame for.  

Not aiming for perfect in this experiment, but looking to see if this will help me capture useful information as a starting point. 

Good artists borrow: Great artists steal: This repo is public so have at it! 

## Setting Up:
1. First I created a Claude AI project. 
1. I uploaded the [Cappy Capture Prompt](prompt/cappy_capture_articles.md) into the instructions area
1. I gave "Cappy" access to the repository on the local file system so it could navigate to the right directories, add files etc.
1. I run the local repo on the "agent" branch, just in case things go funny in a fit of AI "artistic flair".
1. After capturing an article, I do a run through fixing and tweaking info if I need to.
