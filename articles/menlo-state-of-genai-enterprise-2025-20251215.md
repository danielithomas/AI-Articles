## Key Points
- Enterprise AI spending reached $37 billion in 2025, representing a 3.2x year-over-year increase and making it the fastest-scaling software category in history.
- Enterprises now purchase 76% of AI solutions rather than building internally, up from 53% in 2024, indicating growing maturity and availability of ready-made AI products.
- Anthropic has overtaken OpenAI as the enterprise LLM market leader, capturing 40% of enterprise LLM spend compared to OpenAI's 27%, driven primarily by dominance in coding applications.
- Coding has emerged as AI's first "killer use case" with $4 billion in spending and 50% of developers now using AI coding tools daily.
- AI-native startups have captured 63% of the application layer market, outperforming incumbents despite their established advantages in distribution and enterprise relationships.

## Summary
Menlo Ventures' third annual State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report reveals that enterprise AI has become a $37 billion market in 2025, representing the fastest-scaling software category in modern history. Based on a survey of nearly 500 U.S. enterprise decision-makers, the report demonstrates that despite concerns about AI hype and bubble fears triggered by studies showing high failure rates for generative AI initiatives, the demand side tells a story of broad adoption, real revenue, and measurable productivity gains at scale.

The report identifies significant shifts in how enterprises adopt AI. Purchase intent has increased dramatically, with 76% of AI use cases now purchased rather than built internally, up from 53% in 2024. AI buyers convert at nearly twice the rate of traditional software deals (47% versus 25%), and product-led growth motions drive 27% of AI application spend - nearly four times the rate seen in traditional SaaS. Coding has emerged as AI's definitive "killer use case", capturing $4 billion in spending with code completion, code agents, and AI app builders driving adoption across the software development lifecycle.

At the infrastructure level, Anthropic has overtaken OpenAI as the enterprise LLM market leader, commanding 40% of enterprise spend compared to OpenAI's 27%, driven largely by its dominance in the coding market where it holds 54% share. Looking ahead, Menlo predicts AI will exceed human performance in daily programming tasks, that spending will continue rising despite falling inference costs due to volume increases, and that explainability and governance will become mainstream as agents gain autonomy in enterprise decision-making.
