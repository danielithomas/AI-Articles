## Key Points
- Enterprise AI usage has scaled dramatically with ChatGPT messages growing 8x and API reasoning token consumption increasing 320x year-over-year.
- Workers report saving 40-60 minutes per day using AI and can now complete technical tasks like coding and data analysis outside their traditional roles.
- Growth is global and accelerating across all industries, with the median sector growing 6x year-over-year and technology leading at 11x growth.
- A significant gap exists between AI leaders and laggards, with frontier workers sending 6x more messages than median users.
- Leading enterprises demonstrate consistent patterns including deep system integration, workflow standardisation, executive sponsorship, and deliberate change management.

## Summary
OpenAI's 2025 report examines enterprise AI adoption across more than 1 million business customers, revealing rapid scaling and deepening integration of AI into organisational workflows. The data shows that ChatGPT Enterprise seats increased 9x year-over-year, with weekly messages growing 8x and API reasoning token consumption per organisation surging 320x. Custom GPTs and Projects have seen particularly strong adoption, with weekly users increasing 19x year-to-date, indicating that enterprises are moving beyond experimentation to embed AI into repeatable, multi-step workflows.

The report documents measurable productivity gains and expanding capabilities across enterprise functions. Workers report saving 40-60 minutes per day, with 75% indicating improved speed or quality of output. Significantly, AI is enabling workers to perform tasks beyond their traditional roles, particularly in technical areas like coding and data analysis, with coding-related messages outside engineering roles growing 36% over six months. Industry adoption is broad-based, with the median sector growing 6x year-over-year, whilst healthcare and manufacturing show the fastest growth rates. International adoption is accelerating rapidly, with markets like Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands, and France growing over 143% year-over-year.

The research identifies a growing divide in AI maturity between leaders and laggards. Frontier workers generate 6x more messages than median users and engage across roughly seven distinct task types compared to four for less intensive users, correlating with five times more reported time savings. At the organisational level, frontier firms send 2x more messages per seat and 7x more messages to GPTs than median enterprises. Case studies from companies like Intercom, Lowe's, Indeed, BBVA, Oscar Health, and Moderna demonstrate measurable business outcomes including revenue growth, improved customer experience, cost savings, and accelerated product development. Leading organisations consistently demonstrate deep system integration, workflow standardisation, executive sponsorship, data readiness, and deliberate change management practices.
