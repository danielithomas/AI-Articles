## Key Points

- Only 5% of GenAI pilots achieve rapid revenue acceleration - 95% fail to deliver meaningful business impact
- Failure stems from flawed enterprise integration rather than AI model capability - generic tools fail because they do not adapt to specific workflows
- Shadow AI is pervasive - over 90% of companies have workers using personal AI tools despite only 40% purchasing official LLM subscriptions
- Winning AI implementations focus on learning, memory, and workflow adaptation rather than building general-purpose tools
- Mid-market companies outperform enterprises - top performers achieve pilot-to-production in 90 days while enterprises struggle with pilot-to-scale conversion

## Summary

The MIT NANDA research team conducted a comprehensive study examining generative AI adoption in business, based on interviews with over 150 business leaders, surveys of more than 350 employees, and analysis of 300 public AI deployments conducted between January and June 2025. The report reveals a stark "GenAI Divide" where only 5% of AI pilots lead to meaningful business impact and revenue acceleration, with the remaining 95% failing to deliver expected results.

The study identifies that failure is not caused by AI model limitations but by flawed enterprise integration strategies. Generic AI tools consistently underperform because they cannot adapt to specific workflow requirements. Organisations that focus budgets on high-visibility sales and marketing pilots see poor returns, while those targeting back-office automation and process elimination achieve significantly better results. The research also highlights that enterprises are particularly challenged - large organisations report the lowest rates of pilot-to-scale conversion despite having the highest budgets and headcount dedicated to AI initiatives.

A striking finding is the prevalence of "Shadow AI" - while only 40% of companies officially purchased LLM subscriptions, workers from over 90% of surveyed companies regularly use personal AI tools for work tasks. The research suggests this informal adoption often delivers better ROI than formal initiatives and reveals what actually works for bridging the adoption gap. The report concludes that successful AI implementation requires systems that learn from feedback (66% of executives want this), retain context (63% demand this), and customise deeply to specific workflows. Startups succeeding in this space are those embedding themselves inside workflows and scaling from narrow but high-value footholds rather than building general-purpose solutions.
