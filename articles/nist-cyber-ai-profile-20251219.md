## Key Points
- The Profile addresses three Focus Areas: Securing AI System Components (Secure), Conducting AI-Enabled Cyber Defence (Defend), and Thwarting AI-Enabled Cyber Attacks (Thwart).
- Organised using NIST CSF 2.0 structure with proposed priority levels (High, Moderate, Foundational) for each of the 106 Subcategories across all three Focus Areas.
- AI introduces unique cybersecurity challenges due to contextual, dynamic, and often opaque system behaviour that is harder to predict, diagnose, and document than traditional software.
- Data provenance should be treated with the same gravity as software and hardware supply chains, as training data directly impacts AI system functionality and vulnerability.
- This Initial Preliminary Draft is open for public comment until 30 January 2026 to inform the development of the Initial Public Draft.

## Summary
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Artificial Intelligence (Cyber AI Profile) provides voluntary guidance for organisations to manage cybersecurity risks related to AI systems while identifying opportunities to leverage AI for enhanced cybersecurity capabilities. The Profile complements existing NIST frameworks including the Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and the AI Risk Management Framework, offering a consistent approach for discussing how AI advances inform cybersecurity risk management strategies. It is designed for any organisation using AI technologies, seeking to understand defensive AI capabilities, or preparing defences against AI-enabled cyber attacks.

The Profile organises guidance around three interconnected Focus Areas. "Secure" addresses managing cybersecurity challenges when integrating AI into organisational ecosystems, recognising that AI behaviour and vulnerabilities tend to be more contextual and unpredictable than traditional systems. "Defend" identifies opportunities to use AI for enhancing cybersecurity processes including threat detection, incident response automation, compliance monitoring, and predictive risk management. "Thwart" focuses on building resilience against AI-enabled attack vectors such as sophisticated phishing, deepfakes, AI-generated malware, and autonomous attack orchestration that can operate at unprecedented speed and scale.

The document provides detailed considerations mapped to all CSF Functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) with proposed priorities and AI-specific considerations for each Subcategory. Key themes include the critical importance of human oversight for AI-driven decisions, the need for AI-specific identity management and access controls, enhanced supply chain risk management encompassing data provenance, and the necessity of continuous monitoring for AI-specific threats including adversarial inputs and model manipulation. The Profile emphasises that while AI systems require unique cybersecurity considerations, organisations should integrate these into existing cybersecurity programs rather than treating them as entirely separate concerns.
