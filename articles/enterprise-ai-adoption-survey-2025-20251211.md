## Summary
This report from Writer, conducted in partnership with Workplace Intelligence, surveyed 1,600 knowledge workers including 800 C-suite executives and 800 employees across the US. While optimism around AI is at an all-time high - with 88% of employees and 97% of executives reporting benefits from generative AI - nearly two-thirds of C-suite executives report that adoption has sparked division within their organisations.

The research identifies significant barriers to successful AI implementation, including power struggles, conflicts, silos, and even sabotage. Only 45% of employees believe their organisation has successfully adopted AI compared to 75% of executives, highlighting a substantial perception gap. IT departments are developing AI applications in isolation, and 35% of employees are paying out-of-pocket for AI tools because they are unhappy with employer-provided options.

The report emphasises that strategic investment and a people-first approach are essential for success. Companies with formal AI strategies report more than double the success rate of those without. Empowering AI champions - enthusiastic users who inspire colleagues - and fostering cross-functional collaboration between IT and business teams are highlighted as key success factors. The report also notes that enterprises expect vendors to act as strategic partners rather than just software providers, with 98% of C-suite believing vendors should help set the vision for AI at work.
