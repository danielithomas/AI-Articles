## Summary

Microsoft has announced Agent 365, a comprehensive control plane designed to help organisations manage, govern, and secure AI agents at enterprise scale. As the number of AI agents proliferates across organisations, Agent 365 addresses the critical challenge of managing agents using the same infrastructure, applications, and protections that businesses already trust. The platform provides unified observability across an organisation's entire agent fleet through telemetry, dashboards, and alerts, eliminating blind spots and reducing operational risk.

The platform delivers five core capabilities that enable enterprise-scale AI adoption. The Registry provides a single source of truth for all agents through Microsoft Entra, including shadow agents, with the ability to quarantine unsanctioned agents. Access Control ensures agents operate with least-privilege access through unique agent IDs and adaptive, risk-based policies. Visualisation offers unified dashboards and role-based reporting that provide actionable insights into agent performance, connections, and ROI. Interoperability allows agents to access Work IQ—the organisation's unique data, relationships, and context—and integrate with Microsoft 365 applications and business data. Security delivers defence-in-depth protection through Microsoft Defender for threat detection and Microsoft Purview for data protection and compliance.

Agent 365 supports flexible development paths including Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, Microsoft Agent Framework, and the Agent 365 SDK, working across Microsoft platforms, open-source frameworks, and partner clouds. The platform is accessible through the Microsoft 365 admin centre and integrates with existing security tools that IT teams already use. Microsoft is building a robust ecosystem with partners including Adobe, Databricks, SAP, ServiceNow, Workday, and open-source frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Early access to Agent 365 capabilities is available through Microsoft's Frontier programme for AI innovations.
