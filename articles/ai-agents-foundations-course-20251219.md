## Key Points
- The course teaches AI agent fundamentals from scratch without relying on any specific frameworks, focusing on building intuition rather than tool-specific knowledge.
- Context engineering has replaced simple prompt engineering as the core skill for 2025, addressing context decay issues that emerge when context exceeds approximately 32,000 tokens.
- Five workflow patterns (Prompt Chaining, Parallelisation, Routing, Orchestrator-Worker, Evaluator-Optimiser) should be tried before jumping to full agent implementations.
- Planning - specifically ReAct and Plan-and-Execute patterns - is the key factor that distinguishes true agents from simple tool-calling loops.
- Multimodal agents should process data in native formats rather than converting everything to text, preserving rich visual information for better performance.

## Summary
This article introduces a free nine-lesson course on AI agent fundamentals, designed to teach practitioners how to build AI agents from scratch without dependency on specific frameworks. The course covers the complete spectrum from basic workflows to sophisticated multimodal agents, emphasising conceptual understanding over tool-specific implementation. By building examples from scratch, learners develop the intuition needed to architect robust AI solutions and ask the right questions when using any AI framework.

The curriculum progresses logically through foundational concepts: distinguishing workflows from agents via the "autonomy slider," mastering context engineering to prevent context decay, implementing structured outputs for reliable LLM responses, and applying five core workflow patterns before considering full agent architectures. The course then advances to tool calling mechanisms, planning strategies (ReAct and Plan-and-Execute), building ReAct agents from scratch, implementing agent memory systems, and handling multimodal data without lossy text conversion.

A key theme throughout is the importance of understanding fundamentals before adopting frameworks. The author shares practical lessons learned from building production systems, including the pitfalls of over-relying on frameworks like LangGraph and the critical role of planning in transforming simple tool-calling loops into true agents. The course is freely available through the Decoding AI Magazine, with each lesson published as a standalone article that can be followed sequentially.
