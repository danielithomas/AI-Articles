- 72% of enterprises formally measure Gen AI ROI, with three-quarters already reporting positive returns on their investments.
- 89% of leaders agree Gen AI enhances employees' skills, though 43% express concern about potential declines in skill proficiency over time.
- 88% anticipate Gen AI budget increases in the next 12 months, with approximately 30% of technology budgets now allocated to internal R&D.
- Chief AI Officers (CAIOs) are now present in 60% of enterprises, indicating C-suite ownership of AI strategy is consolidating.

## Summary
This is the third annual report from Wharton Human-AI Research and GBK Collective tracking enterprise adoption of generative AI. The study surveyed approximately 800 U.S.-based enterprise decision-makers (from organisations with 1000+ employees and greater than $50 million revenue) between June and July 2025. The findings reveal that Gen AI has decisively shifted from experimentation to mainstream daily use, with adoption now embedded in core workflows across industries and functional areas.

The report identifies three key themes shaping enterprise AI adoption. First, "Everyday AI" demonstrates that usage is now mainstream, with daily adoption common and expertise levels rising across most departments. Second, "Proving Value" shows that 72% of organisations formally measure ROI, with productivity gains and incremental profit as primary metrics - and three-quarters already seeing positive returns. Third, "The Human Capital Lever" reveals that people, not tools, now set the pace of adoption. While Tech/Telecom, Banking/Finance, and Professional Services lead adoption (90%+ weekly usage), Retail (63%) and Manufacturing (80%) lag behind, suggesting the divide between AI-enabled and non-AI-enabled enterprises is widening.

The findings highlight a critical inflection point: while budgets continue to grow and executive leadership is increasingly involved, the constraint has shifted from technology to human capital. Training investment is softening (down 8 percentage points), advanced AI talent remains difficult to recruit (cited by 49% as a challenge), and concerns about skill atrophy are emerging even as most leaders view Gen AI as skill-enhancing. The report suggests 2026 could mark the transition from "accountable acceleration" to "performance at scale" - where established ROI metrics and governance frameworks enable enterprises to rewire core workflows and deploy agentic systems more broadly.
