## Key Points
- The AI tech stack comprises five interdependent layers: Governance (rules and protocols), Application (user interface), Infrastructure (computational foundation), Model (core algorithms), and Data (foundational raw material).
- Each layer presents distinct security vulnerabilities requiring layer-specific defences: governance risks include rogue agents and compliance failures, applications face prompt injection and API exploitation, infrastructure confronts physical attacks and resource hijacking, models are susceptible to adversarial attacks and theft, whilst data layers risk poisoning and privacy violations.
- Data and Model layers are prioritised for security focus, as data poisoning can fundamentally compromise system integrity at source, and models represent high-value targets containing sensitive enterprise data and valuable intellectual property.
- The framework evolves beyond the earlier "AI Triad" (algorithm, compute, data) to account for production environments, applications, and governance requirements that weren't captured in the original conceptualisation.
- Securing AI systems requires collaborative efforts between policymakers, cybersecurity practitioners, and industry stakeholders to develop frameworks that balance innovation with essential safeguards through standardised protocols similar to internet security standards (TLS, HTTPS, DNSSEC).

## Summary
This comprehensive primer from the Paladin Global Institute provides policymakers and cybersecurity practitioners with a structured framework for understanding and securing modern AI systems. The report positions AI as a transformational technology comparable to electricity, the automobile, and the Internet, arguing that securing its foundations at the outset is critical for realising its economic and societal benefits. The authors introduce a five-layer AI technology stack that supersedes the earlier "AI Triad" conceptualisation, offering a more nuanced model that accounts for production deployment realities, user interfaces, and governance requirements absent from earlier frameworks.

The five layers operate as interdependent components where vulnerabilities cascade across the stack—a poisoned training dataset corrupts models, leading to unpredictable application behaviour and ultimately governance failures with public consequences. Each layer presents distinct security challenges: the Governance layer requires dynamic protocol development similar to internet standards; Applications face prompt injection attacks and API exploitation; Infrastructure demands physical security, access controls, and supply chain risk management; Models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, theft, and inversion; whilst the Data layer confronts poisoning attempts, privacy violations, and bias introduction. The report emphasises that Data and Model layers merit prioritisation, as they represent both the foundation and core value of AI systems.

The framework serves dual purposes: providing technical literacy for policy development whilst enabling systematic security analysis across the AI lifecycle. The authors argue that isolated technical safeguards are insufficient—comprehensive security requires cross-layer governance, threat models, and oversight mechanisms that address interdependencies holistically. Looking forward, the report positions AI security as distinct from Responsible AI (which focuses on fairness, transparency, and accountability), instead emphasising defence-in-depth strategies against cyber threats and nation-state espionage. Organisations embedding security throughout the stack will establish technical standards, governance frameworks, and ethical guidelines that define responsible AI development globally, positioning themselves as leaders in tomorrow's digital economy whilst strengthening national security postures.
