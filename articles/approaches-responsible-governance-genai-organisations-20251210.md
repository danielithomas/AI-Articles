## Summary
This peer-reviewed paper addresses the rapidly evolving challenges of governing Generative AI in organisational contexts, where unprecedented opportunities must be balanced with complex ethical, accountability, and societal concerns. The authors synthesise insights from existing governance frameworks (including NIST AI Risk Management Framework, ISO AI Standards, and Singapore's Model AI Governance Framework), literature analysis, and structured industry roundtable discussions to identify fundamental principles for responsible GenAI governance. Their work reveals gaps in current frameworks around risk assessment granularity, cross-sector adaptability, vendor oversight, and accountability structures.

The paper proposes a layered governance approach incorporating strategic, operational, and tactical considerations to foster responsible innovation. Key recommendations emphasise developing adaptable risk assessment tools, implementing continuous monitoring practices, embedding governance into daily workflows, and establishing decision-support mechanisms like risk matrices and lifecycle checkpoints. The authors stress that effective governance must be an adaptive strategy rather than static compliance, integrating GenAI applications into an organisation's long-term goals, ethical standards, and regulatory obligations whilst enhancing system efficiency, reliability, and fairness.

As a practical outcome, the research team developed the interactive Responsible GenAI Guide (ResAI), an online resource featuring a GenAI-powered chatbot that provides contextualised guidance based on key governance principles and industry best practices. The work addresses critical operational challenges including data privacy and integrity (GDPR, CCPA compliance), bias detection and mitigation, transparency and explainability requirements, and the infrastructure demands of continuous model maintenance. The authors advocate for cross-border collaboration to develop harmonised, universally recognised governance protocols that can scale across different regulatory environments and organisational contexts.
