## Summary
Australian businesses are investing heavily in AI but struggling to see returns, with only 14% of CEOs reporting revenue gains compared to 30% globally according to PwC's Global CEO Survey. Companies face challenges including AI skills shortages, inadequate investment, and a lack of innovation beyond basic chatbot implementations. Those adopting AI-first design principles achieve ROI 20 times higher than companies using only mainstream productivity tools.

The risk landscape has shifted dramatically, with AI jumping from eighth to first place in the Allianz Risk Barometer for Australian businesses between 2025 and 2026. This concern outranks even cybersecurity, reflecting worries about operational, legal, and reputational risks from automated decision-making and lack of transparency in AI systems. Government analysis found many federal agencies still lack transparency around their use of AI-driven automated decision making.

Despite these challenges, Australian businesses remain optimistic about future growth, with 49% of CEOs confident about revenue growth over the next 12 months. However, systemic issues persist including poor IT infrastructure readiness (only 38% believe systems can handle AI demands), data quality challenges, and difficulty demonstrating ROI. A Snowflake/Ecosystem analysis found 81% of Australian firms struggled to quantify AI investment value, the world's second-highest rate of ROI failure, largely because only 19% had fully integrated AI into their business strategy.
