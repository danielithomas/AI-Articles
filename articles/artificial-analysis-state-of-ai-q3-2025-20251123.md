## Key Points
- GPT-5 reclaimed the top intelligence spot with a score of 68 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, followed closely by Grok 4, Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking), and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
- AI inference pricing declined approximately 50% for frontier models during Q3 2025, driven by releases of Grok 4 Fast, GPT-5 nano, and gpt-oss-20B.
- Agent capabilities became the focal point for AI labs, with models increasingly pre-trained and optimised for tool use and multi-step agentic workflows.
- Chinese labs maintained parity with US firms in image generation and led in video generation, with Kling 2.5 Turbo topping both text-to-video and image-to-video leaderboards.
- NVIDIA's B200 chips demonstrated 3x system throughput advantage over H200 at scale, whilst Blackwell systems became widely available in production environments.

## Summary

The Q3 2025 State of AI report from Artificial Analysis provides comprehensive insights into the rapidly evolving AI landscape across language models, image and video generation, speech capabilities, and hardware acceleration. The report emphasises that innovation continues at pace across the entire AI stack, with no signs of consolidation or clear winners emerging amongst the fierce competition.

In language models, OpenAI reclaimed frontier leadership with GPT-5 (High) scoring 68 on the Intelligence Index, though competition from xAI, Anthropic, and Google remains intense. The quarter saw dramatic price declines of approximately 50% for frontier models, whilst open weights models made significant progress, led by OpenAI's first open weights release since GPT-2. Agent capabilities emerged as the primary focus, with models increasingly optimised for tool use and multi-step workflows. Applications evolved from simple chat interfaces to embedded agents with deep integrations, enabling more complex task execution across coding, research, computer use, and enterprise workflows.

The media generation landscape saw continued advancement, particularly in video models which experienced rapid quality improvements, whilst open weights alternatives lagged behind proprietary options. Chinese and US labs maintained parity in image generation, but Chinese labs led in video with models like Kling 2.5 Turbo. Speech capabilities matured significantly, with Google's Chirp 2 leading transcription accuracy and native Speech-to-Speech models reaching production viability. On the hardware front, NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture demonstrated substantial performance gains, with B200 systems showing 3x throughput advantages over H200 at scale, whilst increasing focus shifted from individual chip performance to system-level optimisation for both training and distributed inference workloads.
