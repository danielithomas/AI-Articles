## Key Points
- AI agent capabilities are growing exponentially, with the time horizon for task completion doubling every 7 months from 2019-2025.
- Researchers at METR found a strong correlation (R² = 0.83) between task length and agent success rate across 200 tasks.
- Extrapolating the trend suggests agents could handle 1-day tasks by 2027, 1-week tasks by 2028, and 1-month tasks by 2029.
- The trend accelerated in 2024-2025 to doubling every 4 months, potentially indicating superexponential growth.
- Increasingly capable AI systems could create a flywheel effect where agents accelerate the development of more capable agents.

## Summary
This article introduces a Moore's Law-like trend for AI agents discovered by researchers at METR. When ChatGPT launched in 2022, it could handle 30-second coding tasks, but today's AI agents can autonomously complete coding tasks that take humans two hours. By testing frontier AI systems from 2019 to 2025 on approximately 200 tasks (mostly coding, some general reasoning), researchers identified that the length of tasks agents can successfully complete is growing exponentially.

The key metric is the "time horizon" - the length of tasks where agents succeed 50% of the time. This has been doubling every 7 months on average from 2019-2025, with a strong statistical correlation (R² = 0.83) between task length and success rate. More notably, the trend accelerated in 2024-2025 to doubling every 4 months. If this exponential growth continues, the extrapolations suggest agents will handle 2-hour tasks in 2026, full work days (8 hours) by 2027, work weeks (40 hours) by 2028, and work months (167 hours) by 2029.

The article highlights that this trend could be even faster than exponential growth, as AI systems become increasingly useful for developing more capable AI systems. This could trigger a flywheel of acceleration where agents speed up the creation of more capable agents. Such automation of AI research could lead to agent capabilities skyrocketing beyond human abilities across many domains, making the increasing time horizon of AI systems potentially one of the most important trends in human history.
