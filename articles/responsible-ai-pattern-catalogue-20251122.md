## Key Points
- The Pattern Catalogue provides a structured, reusable approach to operationalising responsible AI principles across industry, organisation, and team levels throughout the entire AI system lifecycle.
- It addresses the principle-algorithm gap by offering multi-layer patterns (governance, process, and product) rather than staying at abstract ethics principles or algorithm-level solutions alone.
- The catalogue classifies patterns across AI supply chain, system, and operation infrastructure layers, with clear mappings to stakeholder roles and responsibilities throughout development stages.
- All patterns acknowledge both benefits and drawbacks, recognising that responsible AI implementations may introduce additional risks and costs that need careful management.
- The framework has been mapped to major regulations and standards including the EU AI Act and ISO/IEC 42001:2023, providing practical compliance pathways.

## Summary

CSIRO's Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue represents a comprehensive, pattern-oriented approach to operationalising responsible AI across the complete system lifecycle. The catalogue addresses a critical gap in the AI ethics landscape: whilst numerous AI ethics principles frameworks exist (such as Australia's AI Ethics Principles), practitioners have lacked concrete, actionable guidance for implementing these principles in practice. The catalogue moves beyond both abstract principles and narrow algorithm-level solutions to provide reusable patterns that span multiple organisational levels and development stages.

The catalogue is organised into three main pattern categories: governance patterns (spanning industry, organisation, and team levels), process patterns (covering requirements, design, implementation, testing, and operation stages), and product patterns (addressing supply chain, system, and operation infrastructure layers). This multi-dimensional framework enables practitioners to situate their work within a bigger picture, understanding how different practices reinforce each other across levels. The approach explicitly acknowledges the complexity of responsible AI by recognising that individual patterns often address multiple ethical risks simultaneously, whilst also introducing potential drawbacks that must be managed.

The catalogue is grounded in extensive research, including multivocal literature reviews and empirical studies, and provides practical tools such as a Question Bank for responsible AI risk assessment. It defines clear stakeholder classifications across industry, organisation, and team levels, and maps patterns to specific roles and responsibilities. The framework has been validated through mapping to major regulatory frameworks including the EU AI Act and international standards like ISO/IEC 42001:2023, demonstrating its practical applicability for organisations navigating the increasingly complex responsible AI compliance landscape.
