## Key Points
- ClaudeLog is the number one community-driven resource for Claude Code, featuring experiments, insights, and mechanics tested in real development scenarios.
- The site provides comprehensive documentation on advanced mechanics including CLAUDE.md best practices, plan mode, ultrathink, sub-agents, and agent-first design.
- Created by a practitioner who developed bespoke frameworks at Command Stick™, the resource emerged from systematic experimentation with Claude Code's capabilities and limitations.
- Features detailed breakdowns of configuration guides, task context optimisation, and workflow management for reliable Claude Code implementations.
- Represents a paradigm shift from copy-paste AI coding workflows to integrated terminal-based agentic coding where developers set tasks, monitor progress, and review completed work.

## Summary

ClaudeLog is a comprehensive community resource dedicated to mastering Claude Code, Anthropic's agentic coding tool that operates directly in the terminal. The site was created by InventorBlack, CTO at Command Stick™ and moderator of r/ClaudeAI, following extensive experimentation with Claude Code's capabilities whilst developing functionality within novel frameworks for WearOS smartwatch applications.

The resource provides detailed documentation on advanced mechanics and techniques including CLAUDE.md configuration best practices, plan mode operations, ultrathink functionality, sub-agent implementations, and agent-first design principles. The content focuses on practical, tested approaches that emerged from real-world development scenarios, particularly the iterative refinement of CLAUDE.md files into modules of task context, rules, numbered steps, and examples that lead to successful implementations.

ClaudeLog represents the community's collective knowledge about Claude Code's integration paradigm, where the AI's environment integrates directly with the developer's environment rather than requiring manual copy-paste workflows. The site includes configuration guides, workflow management strategies, and detailed observations about what makes Claude Code reliable and efficient, serving as an essential resource for developers seeking to optimise their use of this agentic coding tool.
